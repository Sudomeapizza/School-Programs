This is my Minesweeper project that I made from scratch (not the website scratch.mit.edu :P). It was a bunch of fun making it.

This was my final project for my computer science class.

I got a 110% on it because I got it to open all of the empty spaces when you click an empty spot, and getting it to be able to flag a spot.
