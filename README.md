This is my home page! ï£¿

NOTE:

All of my java projects that i made at school are used in the terminal / eclipse.

I have done all of my projects from scratch! As in I did not copy and paste code from online, and typed it all myself. I coded them as I went from my teacher telling me what to do, and doin it.

Once I have finished my programs, I will put the .java file instead of the .class file. The reason being is that, I don't want any suggestions on how to fix my code. I want to figure it out on my own.

With almost every file, there is a .class and a .java file. The .class file is if you want to just simply run it, and the .java file is if you want to edit it and what not.
