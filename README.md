WWEEEEE!!! I finally finished it!

It only took me 2 weeks to do, but it was worth it!

This is a program that I made is the best one yet. 

This program taught me several things.

–– how to print and read from a file.
–– how and when to use try and catch better
–– use multiple classes
–– and many other things

You will want to compile (or not) and run the BankProject.java (or class).

All of the files are dependant on each other. SO DON'T DELETE ANY OF THEM :P

BUT if you want to update the files as you go, you will need to delete all of the classes then add the new ones.

Anyways, Now about the program.

1. You are able to make "Bank Accounts"

2. Add or subtract "money" from your account

3. use the account again after you end the session

4. lots of fun (in my opinion :D)


Lots more features to come! (*ahem*taxes*cough*)

and more big fixes. ofc.
