This program was a project in my Computer Science class at school.
What it does is, takes in a number that you put in and does the following steps:

1) if the number is even, it divides it by 2
2) if the number is odd, it multiplies it by 3 THEN divides it by two.
3) repeat steps 1 & 2 until the number equals one.

this is a very interesting but simple program. It will show you all the steps that it does to get your numebr to 1.
