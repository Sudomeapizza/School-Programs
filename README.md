This is my home page!! ï£¿ :D

NOTE:

All of my java projects that i made at school are used in the terminal / eclipse.

I have done all of my projects from scratch! As in I did not copy and paste code from online, and typed it all myself. I coded them as I went from my teacher telling me what to do, and doin it.

Once I have finished my programs, I will put the .java file instead of the .class file. The reason being is that, I don't want any suggestions on how to fix my code. I want to figure it out on my own.
